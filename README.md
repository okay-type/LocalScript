# Project Scripts

A [RoboFont] extension that adds a menu item with scripts from the current .ufo’s folder

To use:
- open your project folder
- create a folder named “scripts” next to your .ufos
- fill that scripts folder with all your messy project-specific scripts
- the “Project Scripts” menu item will automatically update when those ufos are open

Requires for [RoboFont 4.0].

Questions and tasks that need to be done:
- this needs an cool icon
- is there better a menu title than 'Project Scripts'?
- does this need a preference to change the folder name or path relative to the ufo?
- are there any optimizations to make?
- are there any events missing?
- would this be better as a submenu in the regular Scripts folder?
    - eg: Scripts -> Project Folder Name -> [project scripts]
