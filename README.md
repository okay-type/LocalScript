# Project Scripts

A [RoboFont] extension that adds a menu item with scripts from the current .ufo’s folder

To use:
- Open your project folder
- Create a folder named “scripts” next to your .ufos
- Fill that scripts folder with all your messy project-specific scripts
- The “Project Scripts” menu will automatically update when you open your .ufos

Requires for [RoboFont 4.0].

Questions and tasks that need to be done:
- Is there better a menu title than 'Project Scripts'?
- Does this need a preference to change the folder name or path relative to the ufo?
- Are there any optimizations to make?
- Are there any events missing?
- Would this be better as a submenu in the regular Scripts folder?
    - eg: Scripts -> Project Folder Name -> [project scripts]
